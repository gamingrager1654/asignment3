 <br><h1 class="about">About Our Fine Establishment</h1>
<b> <p class="aboutP">Our Founder Ronald McWendy Born in 1495, and still alive to this day, is a hero. <br> He has been feeding people his delicous food since he was born. <br>
    He fed his entire settlement and village everyday morning mid-day and night, he was a star. <br>
    His cooking was so good that the gods made a deal with him, giving him eternal life, just as long as he kept making his good food for the people.
    Over the many many hundred years Ronald has learned more and more new foods to cook and they keep getting better, on a rainy morning in 1940, Ronald opened his very first restraunt.<br> 
    Now as you may know World War 2 started around then and Ronald had alot of german and french soilders coming in and out of his restraunt, although he liked the money he was making, the soilders scared off his usual customers. <br>
    And sometimes if the german and french were there at the same time there would be fights, so one day Ronald decided to unite the world with the very first Big Wendy Burger.
    <br> He personally fed the burger to everyone involved in the war and they LOVED it. <br> Eventually not to long after the war ended, and us and McWendys think he stopped World War 2. <br>
    So when you have a chance come into our shop and try the heroic burger that stopped world war 2.
